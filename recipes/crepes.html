    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Here is a simple but delicious crepe batter which can be made in minutes. <em><strong>It's made from ingredients that everyone has on hand.</strong></em>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>

        <li>1 cup of all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>½ cup of milk</li>
        <li>½ cup of water</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of melted butter</li>
    
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>

        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
        <li>Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
